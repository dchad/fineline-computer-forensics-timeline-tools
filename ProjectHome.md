A collection of command line and GUI tools for analysing event logs on Linux and Microsoft Windows computers to generate graphical timelines of events during the investigation of computer security incidents or crimes involving computers.

# 1. Quick Start Guide #

## 1.1 Download ##

User Guide, Windows Binaries, Java GUI Package and source code tarball can be downloaded from:

https://googledrive.com/host/0B6maxAp3j2akRnBvcGdSTThJbXM/

Unzip the binary package into any directory, no installation or system configuration is required.

The following applications are included in the Windows binary package:

  * FineLineGUIJava.jar - FineLine GUI.

  * fineline.exe - analyse Windows EVT/EVTX log files.

  * fineline-ie.exe - analyse Internet Explorer 10+ WebCacheV01.dat cache files.

  * fineline-iepre10.exe - analyse Internet Explorer 1 - 9 index.dat cache files.

  * TODO fineline-ws.exe - analyse Windows Search database files.

  * TODO fineline-wl.exe - analyse Windows Live database files.

  * TODO fineline-search.exe - GUI for searching forensic images and live filesystems.

  * TODO fineline-sensor.exe - monitor network connections on live systems or analyse pcap/unified2 log files.


## 1.2 Generate Event Files ##

Copy the .evt/.evtx files you want to analyse to the FineLine directory. The recommended process is to analyse Security.evtx to obtain a basic computer usage timeline and use this as the starting point for the project/investigation. Windows event files are usually located in: C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs

**Basic Usage:**

Use the command line tools or the Java GUI to analyse the .evt/.evtx files, for example:

C:\fineline\fineline.exe -w -i Security.evtx

This will parse the Security.evtx event records and generate an output file called **fineline-events-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.fle**

The **.fle** file extension is not mandatory, you can specify any file name for output using the "-o" option. For example:

C:\fineline\fineline.exe -w -i System.evtx -o my-system-events.txt

**Using Filters:**

An optional filter file can be used to remove extraneous events. The file "fl-filter-list.txt" is included in the download package or you can create your own custom filters using a text editor. For example:

C:\fineline\fineline.exe -w -i Security.evtx -f fl-filter-list.txt

**Using a Network Connection:**

Events can also be sent to the GUI via TCP/IP if the GUI is already running on the local machine or another host on the network. For example:

C:\fineline\fineline.exe -s -a 127.0.0.1 -i Security.evtx

**Using the GUI:**

To view a graphical timeline of events, start the Java GUI by double clicking on the jar file: FineLineGUIJava.jar


From the File menu select the Open menu item and use the file open dialogue to select the generated event file: fineline-events-YYYMMDD-HHMMSS.fle

When the event file has been imported you can add/delete or modify events on the timeline or manually add external events/evidence by right clicking on the timeline and selecting the appropriate command from the popup menu.

You can also import event files such as Syslog or MACTIME/FLS files using the Import menu item on the File menu.

The command line tools can also be run from the GUI in the filters tab.

## 1.3 Event File Analysis ##

From the forensics/security point of view most event records generated by an OS are irrelevant and attempting to analyse large volumes of these records is counter-productive. Therefore, the recommended method is to start the event analysis by focusing on a particular subset of security related events (Microsoft, 2014), (NSA/CSA, 2013).

For Microsoft Windows systems, these events include:

**Filtering:**

The initial analysis should use aggressive filtering to remove extraneous events, for example:

C:\fineline\fineline.exe -s -a 192.168.1.100 -i Security.evtx -f fl-filter-list.txt

The file "fl-filter-list.txt" is included in the FineLine package and contains a list of 400 security related Windows event identifiers and filter flags, for example:

512 0
513 0
514 1
515 1
516 1
517 1
518 1
519 1
520 0
521 1
528 0
529 1
530 1
531 1
532 1
533 1
534 1
535 1
536 1
537 1
538 1
...

A flag value of 0 means include this event type and a flag value of 1 means filter out this event type. In this example almost all event types are filtered out as they are not relevant to the current stage of the investigation.




## 1.4 Project/Case Management ##

TODO:

# 2. Installation From Source #

## 2.1 Windows Build ##

Requirements:

  * libevt/libevtx/libesedb/libmsiecf by Joachim Metz (http://code.google.com/p/libevtx/)
  * Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7 or later to build the GUI.
  * Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 or Visual Studio 2012 to build the command line tools.

Download the FineLine source code package and unzip into any directory.

### 2.1.1 Java GUI ###

Building the FineLine GUI requires version 1.7 of the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK).
The GUI can be built using an IDE such as Netbeans or from the command line using the Java compiler. In Netbeans, open the project and select "Clean and Build" from the run menu.



### 2.1.2 Command Line Tools ###

The FineLine source package includes a Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 solution file. You will need to download and build the libevt/libevtx/libesedb/libmsiecf libraries before building FineLine. The latest source code for libevt/libevtx can be obtained from: http://code.google.com/p/libevtx/

The easiest method of building libevt/libevtx on Windows is to use the Microsoft Visual C++ project file included with the libraries. Instructions are available on the libevtx Google Code page. After building libevt.dll and libevtx.dll you can install them using regsvr32.exe, if you get an error saying "Entry point not found" then just copy the DLL files to the FineLine build directory.

To build the FineLine tools open the MSVC project file, go to the project properties and change the include and linker search directories to the location of your libevt/libevtx build. For example:

Header Files - C:\libevtx20130101\include;C:\libevt20130101\include;

Libraries - C:\libevtx20130101\msvcpp\Release;C:\libevt20130101\msvcpp\Release;

Now select the "Build Project" item from the build menu. When the build is complete you should have the following files in the various build directories:

  * fineline.exe

  * fineline-ie.exe

  * fineline-iepre10.exe

  * FineLineGUIJava.jar

  * libevt.dll

  * libevtx.dll

  * fl-event-filter-list-example.txt

  * fl-url-filter-list-example.txt

  * fl-windows-security-event-list.txt

Copy all these files to a single directory then copy the .evt/.evtx files you want to analyse to the same directory for analysis.




## 2.2 Linux Build And Install ##

Download, build and install the libevt/libevtx tools according to the instructions at http://code.google.com/p/libevtx/.

### 2.2.1 Command Line Tools ###

Unzip the FineLine source code package into any directory, open the Makefile in a text editor and change the INCLUDE line to point to the required libevt/libevtx include directories. For example:

INCLUDES=-I/home/fred/libevtx-20131211/common/ -I/home/fred/libevtx-20131211/libfdatetime/ -I/home/fred/libevtx-20131211/libcerror/ -I/home/fred/libevtx-20131211/libcstring/

Aternatively you can just copy all the libevt/libevtx header files to /usr/local/include.

Now build the tools with:

make

make strip


### 2.2.2 FineLine GUI ###

As per Windows build, open the project in Netbeans or similar Java IDE and run the build function. In Netbeans, open the project and select "Clean and Build" from the run menu.
